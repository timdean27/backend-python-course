Databases in Django

Two Ways of Interacting with Databases

1. ORM (Object-Relational Mapper)
   - An ORM allows you to interact with the database using Python code instead of writing raw SQL queries.
   - Djangoâ€™s ORM automatically maps models to database tables and handles CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

2. Direct SQL Interaction
   - You can execute raw SQL queries directly on the database.
   - This method is more flexible but requires a deeper understanding of SQL and the database schema.

Migrations

- Migrations describe the structure of the database and track changes over time.
- They allow you to evolve your database schema as your application requirements change without losing data.
- Migrations are created automatically by Django when you make changes to your models, and can be applied to the database using commands like `makemigrations` and `migrate`.

Models

- Models describe the data structure and define the schema for your database.
- Each model maps to a single table in the database, and each attribute of the model corresponds to a database column.
- Models also define the behavior of your data through methods, validation, and relationships.
