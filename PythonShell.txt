how to use Python Shell to work with data
we can typicaly use a python shell by just typing the command 
- python

but with django manage we can work within 
- python manage.py shell

we run from mainProject.models import File
to import the Files table into the shell

can run File.objects.all() - will get a queryset which retunrs a list of objects of all recoreds
which should return all objects from the files model which is a table in SQL , all objects returned are recoreds in the table 

we can intirate through the List 
example:
for file in File.objects.all():
    print(file.name)


you can get single file objects for example 
File.objects.get(pk=1)

you will be reutned the object with primary key value 1


how to see all the atribuits of a paticular object 
- we can assign the obecjts to a variabe
fileOne = File.objects.get(pk=1)

then say dir(fileOne)
